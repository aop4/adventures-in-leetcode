This is a collection of original solutions to algorithms problems from Leetcode and other sources.

For me, practicing algorithms problems is about more than interview prep. I look at them as puzzles, and I solve them for the sake of solving them.  

The solutions I add here will always be my own, written and set in stone before I looked at any other solutions. As such they might not always be optimalâ€”they're the best thing I could come up with.  

One reason I want to store these solutions here is so that I can write them the way I typically write code, in an IDE with unit tests and documentation. Another reason is ownership of all the work I put into these problems.
